# randomwalker
A computational study of random walk (RW) and self-avoiding walk (SAW).

# remark
In the SAW code one can see the possibility of enconter a path in which the walker is unable to walk in any direction. The algorithm takes into account this consideration reinitializing the walker so that the "blocked walk" does not contribute to the statistics.
